# ZenseSDK_ArmLinux
** For aarch64 architectures. **

This is the Linux SDK for the Pico Zense TOF RGBD Camera (DCAM710), for ARM 64-bit (aarch64) CPU architectures. 

The DCAM710 is a standalone 3D camera hardware module, developed by Pico Interactive, Inc., that uses time-of-flight (TOF) technology to capture depth information while recording imagery. The DCAM710 is packaged in a small form factor and can adapt to a wide range of environments while providing high-precision depth information.

The ARM Linux SDK is built for three common ARM architecture: armhf, arm32 and aarch64. Versions for particular architectures are in their own branch:

- [armhf](https://github.com/PicoInteractive/ZenseSDK_ArmLinux/tree/armhf-linux)
- [arm32](https://github.com/PicoInteractive/ZenseSDK_ArmLinux/tree/arm32-linux)
- [aarch64](https://github.com/PicoInteractive/ZenseSDK_ArmLinux/tree/aarch64-linux)
